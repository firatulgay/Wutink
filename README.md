# Wutink

Wutink is a platform that people can share their experiences about exactly anything on their personel profiles with an anonymous username.

For instance, a person can share his/her experience about a department of a university where he did his master's so the people who are searching to do their master's in the same college and department can get an idea quickly about it and then they can send message to talk about more about details.
